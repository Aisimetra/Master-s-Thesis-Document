Using sensors directly integrated inside the bed makes it possible to monitor physiological signals such as body position, respiratory rate, and heartbeat. The goal is to use this type of sensor not to affect the userâ€™s comfort or cause privacy concerns while his health is monitored. The state-of-the-art to monitor physiological data during sleep is polysomnography. However, this cumbersome device requires cables attached to the users' bodies and often interferes with natural sleep. A pressure-sensor textile placed on the mattress avoid this kind of issue and allow to monitor the patient health. The thesis will be focuses on analysing signals coming from a mattress, in which a series of piezoelectric sensors have been incorporated, to estimate the respiratory rate of the patient lying on it.
