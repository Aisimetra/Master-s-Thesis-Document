This work aims to investigate the possibility of estimating a patient's respiratory rate using a sensor pressure mattress and how a rocking bed could influence its use. 
At first, it is focused on studying approaches to extract the breath and heart rate from pressure sensors using a dataset already available from previous studies. Then the work is focused on respiratory rate, and for this reason, it is conducted data collection using an innovative pressure textile-sensor mattress: the primary objective is to collect data to understand the feasibility of extracting breath rate from the mat; the second goal is to understand if the movement of the rocking bed could influence the signal. 
In the second part, a pipeline to analyse the extracted data is created: from each mattress sensor, the signals are processed to exclude the ones without meaningful information and designed metrics that asset the confidence that from a sensor could be extracted a respiratory pattern. The remains signals are filtered to eliminate noise using multiresolution analysis of the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform and Savitz-Golay filter to obtain a clean wave from which could be counted the number of breaths a person in a minute. As a result, the respiration rate per minute of the person is obtained, and a heatmap is used to visualise where these channels are positioned in respect of the body and so in the mattress.
