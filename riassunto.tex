Sleep is one of the most important physiological functions. Sleep quality can affect physical 
and mental wellness; for this reason,
 it is crucial to monitor vital signs without interfering with natural sleep. 
 The state-of-the-art to monitor physiological data during sleep is polysomnography %\cite{Penzel2016ModulationsPolysomnography}
 , which involves recording sleep stages, respiratory rate, heart and other parameters. However, this procedure is time-consuming, 
 complicated, expensive, invasive for the patient and also not always available in hospitals. For this reason, is nowadays 
 acceptable to just use cardiorespiratory polysomnography that does not track neurophysiological variables. This particular type of polysomnography
involves a cannula, chest belts and electrodes for an electrocardiogram (ECG), but does not need electroencephalogram (EEG).
Another reason why this kind of instrument is widely used is that inside the population we have a higher percentage of 
sleep-related breathing disorders that can be studied and monitored with this instrument, like sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (SAS), where the individuals experience a collapse 
of the airway in deeper sleep states. The ability to monitor it allows for a faster and closer intervention in severe cases. 
The sleep cycle of a person is dived up into two  phases Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) and Rapid Eye Movement (REM);
  this second phase is further divided into three other stages (N1-N3). Different muscle tones, brain wave patterns, 
  eye movements, and heart and breathing rate alterations characterise every phase and stage.
%\textbf{[explenation of sleep stages]}.
Focusing on one of the vital signs that characterise the different sleep stages is the respiratory rate 
which slowly becomes more stable going from the awake to the REM phase, this caraterizetion of the diffeernt stages give the possibility to 
undestand the different stage of the person based just on respiratory signal \cite{Bakker2021EstimatingSeverity}. 
%Respiration is also central in 
% one of the most common sleep disorders, sleep apnea, in this case,  causing them to experience reduced time in stage N3 and REM sleep. si pu√≤ evdere da 

As said before, the state-of-art is a cumbersome device that 
requires cables attached to the users' bodies and often interferes with 
natural sleep. For this reason, we decided to use an unobtrusive sensor 
placed over the typical mattress to allow us to study the possibility of
 monitoring the patient's health. The sensor involved in this project is a 
 pressure-sensor textile from SensingTex [x], with a sensor area of 192 x 94 
 cm filled with 1056 sensors (sensor area density of 4 sensors for 10cm$^2$).

 The high number of sensors leads to the necessity of an algorithm to discriminate the ones from whom 
 it is possible to extract valuable information about the respiratory rate of the person that is on the mattress.
 Many of these channels are with null or stationary information; others present just interference from the 
 mattress itself. From just a few sensors, it is possible to retrieve a respiratory pattern and extract the 
 respiratory rate per minute (rpm). To obtain them from all the possibilities, we have defined our confidence 
 metric to assign each sensor a percentage of confidence that it will be a suitable sensor.
 \textbf{[parlare del somnomat]}.

 Since no data and polygraphs were available from the same person
 on the SensingTex was necessary to collect new data, this gives 
 us the possibility also to understand if this kind of Instrument
  could work with a lab project called Somnomat. A special 
  rocking bed \textbf{[parlare del somnomat e di come potrebbe essere integrato]}. The protocol involved 
  6 participants (three female /three male) between 20-30 years of age. It was divided into two phases: one 
  with the sensor mattress over a standard bed and the second on the rocking bed while this was moving. 
  Each participant had a fixed set of positions that had to be while lying on the mattress. 
  We also decide to insert variability into the data since, during sleep, respiratory rate increases in different stages. 
  In order to do that, we ask a participant to perform a set of five jumps before lying down in the first 
  phase of the protocol; for the second part, we ask them to turn around on the bed and stay on it 
  while it is moving without performing any activity.


  the data collection also involved Cardiorespiratory polysomnography. In our case, we use the nox a1 and noxturnal app.
