A total of 86 patients (89\% male, mean age 52 yrs) that had been referred to a sleep laboratory with a clinical diagnosis of SAS underwent cardiorespiratory polygraphy in an unattended mode using an ambulatory device (MERLIN). Analysis was carried out both automatically and manually. Conventional overnight full-channel polysomnography was performed simultaneously. Valid polygraphical recordings were obtained from 79 patients. The mean{\textpm}sd apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) was 34.4{\textpm}29.2. The results obtained with manual scoring were superior to automatic scoring for all AHI thresholds. For an AHI of >=5, which is diagnostic SAS, the optimum cut-off value for the manual respiratory event index was 6.7 and the cardiorespiratory monitoring device had 97.1\% sensitivity and 90.9\% specificity. Correct classification according to the different cut-off points obtained via polysomnography and the corresponding cut-off points in the MERLIN manual index were confirmed in 90{\textendash}96\% of patients. The MERLIN device is a useful diagnostic approach for the initial assessment of adult patients with clinical suspicion of sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome. Manual scoring is clearly better than automatic scoring in terms of agreement with the apnoea/hypopnoea index and to discern patients with sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome. This study was supported by a grant from the Dept of Health, Basque Government.},

abstract = {Polysomnography refers to a systematic process used to collect physiologic parameters during sleep. A polysomnogram (PSG) is a procedure that utilizes electroencephalogram, electro-oculogram, electromyogram, electrocardiogram, and pulse oximetry, as well as airflow and respiratory effort, to evaluate for underlying causes of sleep disturbances. PSG is considered to be the gold standard for diagnosing sleep-related breathing disorders, which include obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central sleep apnea, and sleep-related hypoventilation/hypoxia. PSG can also be utilized to evaluate for other sleep disorders, including nocturnal seizures, narcolepsy, periodic limb movement disorder, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. With recent technological developments, home sleep apnea testing can be done to confirm a diagnosis in patients with a high risk for moderate to severe OSA in the absence of comorbid medical conditions or other suspected sleep disorders.}

abstract = {The electrooculogram (EOG) measures the cornea-positive standing potential relative to the back of the eye. By attaching skin electrodes outside the eye near the lateral and medial canthus, the potential can be measured by having the patient move the eyes horizontally a set distance. The voltage becomes smaller in the dark, reaching its lowest potential after 8–12min, the so-called dark trough. When the lights are turned on, the potential rises, reaching a peak by about 10min. When the size of the light peak is compared to the dark trough, the normal ratio should be near 2:1. A light peak:dark trough ratio of less than 1.7 is considered abnormal. The origin of electrooculographic potentials is the pigment epithelium of the retina interacting with the midretina. The light rise of the potential requires both a normal pigment epithelium and normal midretinal function. The most common use of the electrooculogram is to confirm Best disease. Best disease is identified by the appearance of an egg-yellow fundus and can be confirmed by recording both an electroretinogram (ERG) and electrooculogram (EOG). The ERG will be normal and the EOG will be abnormal. The EOG is also used for tracking eye movement.}
